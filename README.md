Home to all my random minecraft plugins and mods

- [fast-doll](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/minecraft-mods/tree/master/fast-doll) - By default, the player model in the inventory is rendered at only 20FPS, this mod renders it at full speed.
- [MastodonLink](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/minecraft-mods/tree/master/MastodonLink) - A plugin that requires players to link their mastodon account before playing.

## Legacy Projects

These are projects that are no longer supported.
These are awful, so it's ~~probably~~ definitely best to just *not use them*.

- [NoseBot](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/minecraft-mods/tree/master/NoseBot) - I don't even know how to explain this without sounding insane
